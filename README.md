# ESD-IOT-LAB-IT-II
List of Experiments:
1. Functional Testing Of Devices
Flashing the OS on to the device into a stable functional state by porting desktop environment with
necessary packages.
2. Exporting Display On To Other Systems
Making use of available laptop/desktop displays as a display for the device using SSH client & X11
display server.
3. GPIO Programming
Programming of available GPIO pins of the corresponding device using native programming language.
Interfacing of I/O devices like LED/Switch etc., and testing the functionality.
4. Interfacing Chronos eZ430
Chronos device is a programmable texas instruments watch which can be used for multiple purposes
like PPT control, Mouse operations etc., Exploit the features of the device by interfacing with devices.
5. ON/OFF Control Based On Light Intensity
Using the light sensors, monitor the surrounding light intensity & automatically turn ON/OFF the high
intensity LED's by taking some pre-defined threshold light intensity value.
6. Battery Voltage Range Indicator
Monitor the voltage level of the battery and indicating the same using multiple LED's (for ex: for 3V
battery and 3 led's, turn on 3 led's for 2-3V, 2 led's for 1-2V, 1 led for 0.1-1V & turn off all for 0V)
7. Dice Game Simulation
Instead of using the conventional dice, generate a random value similar to dice value and display the
same using a 16X2 LCD. A possible extension could be to provide the user with option of selecting
single or double dice game.
8. Displaying RSS News Feed On Display Interface
Displaying the RSS news feed headlines on a LCD display connected to device. This can be adapted
to other websites like twitter or other information websites. Python can be used to acquire data from the
internet.
9. Porting Openwrt To the Device
Attempt to use the device while connecting to a wifi network using a USB dongle and at the same time
providing a wireless access point to the dongle.
10. Hosting a website on Board
Building and hosting a simple website(static/dynamic) on the device and make it accessible online.
There is a need to install server(eg: Apache) and thereby host the website.
11. Webcam Server
Interfacing the regular usb webcam with the device and turn it into fully functional IP webcam & test the
functionality.
12. FM Transmission
Transforming the device into a regular fm transmitter capable of transmitting audio at desired frequency
(generally 88-108 Mhz)
Note: Devices mentioned in the above lists include Arduino, Raspbery Pi, Beaglebone
